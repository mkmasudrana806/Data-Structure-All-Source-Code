/*
if i write 5+1; this is an expression. operand + operator + operand = expression
note: operand could a expression.example: (a+3) + 4; here 4 and a+3 is operand but a+3 separately expression.
so expression could operand.

precedence :
1. (),{},[]
2. pow ^ R-L
3. *, / L-R
4. +, - L-R


example: 2^2^3; rule is right to left. so answer is 256. but left to R is 64.
but 256 is true.

prefix means : polish
